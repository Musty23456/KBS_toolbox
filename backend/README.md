# KBS Toolbox — Backend API

FastAPI + PostgreSQL backend for KBS Toolbox, an offline-first survey and
data-collection platform. This service is the single source of truth for
surveys, users, and submissions, consumed by both the Android app and the
web admin dashboard.

## Stack

- **Python 3.12 / FastAPI** — REST API
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0** — ORM
- **Alembic** — database migrations
- **PostgreSQL** — production database (SQLite supported for local/dev/test)
- **JWT (python-jose)** — authentication, with server-side revocation on logout
- **passlib[bcrypt]** — password hashing

## Running locally with Docker (recommended)

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set a real JWT_SECRET_KEY at minimum
docker compose up --build
```

This starts Postgres, runs migrations, seeds demo data, and starts the API
at `http://localhost:8000`. Interactive API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Running locally without Docker

Requires Python 3.12+ and a running PostgreSQL instance (or use SQLite for
a zero-install quick start).

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# For a zero-dependency quick start, edit .env and set:
#   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./kbs_toolbox.db

alembic upgrade head
python -m app.seed
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Running tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -v
```

Tests run against an isolated SQLite database and never touch your
development database.

## Environment variables

See `.env.example` for the full list. At minimum, change `JWT_SECRET_KEY`
before any non-local deployment — generate one with:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(64))"
```

## Demo credentials

After running the seed script (`python -m app.seed`, or automatically via
`docker compose up`):

| Role          | Email                          | Password      |
|---------------|---------------------------------|---------------|
| Administrator | admin@kbstoolbox.local           | ChangeMe123!  |
| Supervisor    | supervisor@kbstoolbox.local      | ChangeMe123!  |
| Enumerator    | enumerator@kbstoolbox.local      | ChangeMe123!  |

**Change or remove these before any production deployment.**

## API overview

All endpoints are prefixed `/api`. Full interactive documentation (with
request/response schemas) is auto-generated at `/docs` (Swagger) and
`/redoc` once the server is running.

- `POST /api/auth/register`, `/login`, `/login-json`, `/logout`, `GET /me`
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/users` (admin-only management)
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/surveys`, plus `/publish` and `/unpublish`
- `POST/GET /api/submissions`
- `POST /api/sync/upload` — batch upload of an Android device's offline queue
- `GET /api/sync/download` — full definitions of all published surveys, for
  offline caching on-device

## Design notes

- **Survey versioning**: editing a published survey's questions creates a
  new immutable `SurveyVersion` rather than mutating the old one, so past
  submissions always remain interpretable against the exact form they were
  collected with.
- **Skip logic / calculated fields**: `relevance_expression` and
  `calculation_expression` on each question use a small restricted
  expression language (see `app/services/expressions.py`) — never Python's
  `eval()` — so survey authors can write conditions like
  `gender == 'FEMALE' and age_years >= 12` safely.
- **Offline sync idempotency**: every submission carries a
  `client_submission_uuid` generated on-device at capture time. Retried
  uploads (e.g. after a dropped connection) are deduplicated server-side by
  this key — the sync endpoint is safe to retry an entire batch.
- **Server-side re-validation**: submission answers are re-validated against
  the survey's rules on the server, not trusted from the client, so a
  tampered or buggy offline client can't bypass required-field or
  range/regex rules.

## Known limitations / next steps

- Media answers (photo/audio/signature) currently store a `media_reference`
  string (an object-storage key or path) rather than accepting binary
  uploads directly — a `/api/media/upload` endpoint backed by S3-compatible
  object storage is a natural next addition.
- The in-process rate limiter in `main.py` is per-instance; a multi-instance
  production deployment should swap it for a shared store (e.g. Redis).
- `cascade_parent_question_id` / `cascade_parent_value` model the data
  needed for cascading selects (e.g. State → LGA); the actual cascade
  filtering logic belongs in the client (Android/web) form renderer, which
  reads these fields from the downloaded survey definition.
